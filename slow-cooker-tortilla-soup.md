# Vegetarian Lentil Tortilla Soup

Recipe yields approx, 6 cups of soup.

## Ingredients

-   1 cup diced onion
-   1 tsp avocado oil (or olive oil)
-   1 bell pepper diced
-   1 jalapeno pepper diced
-   2.5 cups vegetable broth (or chicken broth if needed)
-   15 oz canned tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes
-   1/2 cup mild or medium salsa verde (or your favorite salsa!)
-   1 TBSP tomato paste
-   15 oz can black beans (drained + rinsed)
-   15 oz can pinto beans (drained + rinsed)
-   1 cup corn (fresh, canned, or frozen)
-   3/4 cup dried red lentils
-   1/2 tsp chili powder
-   1/2 tsp garlic powder
-   1/2 tsp cumin
-   1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
-   1/4-1/2 cup heavy cream* (optional - see notes)
-   salt and pepper to taste

Pile on the toppings!

-   crushed tortilla chips (my favorite!)
-   shredded cheddar or mex-blend cheese
-   sliced or diced jalapeños
-   chopped red onion
-   pico de gallo
-   sliced avocado
-   fresh cilantro
-   sour cream or greek yogurt

## Instructions

1.  First chop your veggies and measure out the ingredients. This will
    make everything super easy to toss together!

2.  Next add everything except the heavy cream and toppings.

3.  Cook on high for 4-6 hours or low for 7-8 hours, until dried lentils
    are cooked through and veggies are tender. My soup was perfect after
    5 hours on high.

4.  Swirl in the cream, add all your favorite toppings, and dive in!

## Recipe Notes

* In place of the heavy cream, feel free to use half-and-half or cream
cheese. Skipping the cream? No problem! This recipe can be made without
it - let your tastebuds be your guide.

* For a thicker soup, feel free to add some corn tortillas (torn into
pieces) to the soup or simply swirl crushed tortilla chips into the soup
after serving!

* Feel free to adjust the consistency of the soup to your liking. The soup
can be thinned with a little broth or tomato sauce if desired or
thickened with extra cream or beans/veggies! If you add a lot of extra
liquid, consider amping up the spices a smidge to compensate. You can
also make this as mild or as spicy as you'd like. As written it's on the
medium side. The type of salsa used, jalapeños, and cayenne pepper will
control the heat factor.

* Want it super chunky? Feel free to add extra beans and veggies! Simply
amp up the seasoning as needed depending on how much extra goodies you
add to the pot.

* **A note on salt and pepper:** I leave salting the dish to the end to
prevent over-seasoning. Depending on the brand and type of broth,
tomatoes, and beans that you use, the sodium content will vary. I
usually don't add any salt until the end once I am able to taste the
soup.
